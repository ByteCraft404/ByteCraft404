## About Me

I consider myself passionate about software development and have experience as a backend engineer and mobile developer, progressively adapting toward full-stack development. My preferred language is Java, and I focus on backend development, building systems on Spring Boot. In mobile development, I develop AI-enhanced native Android applications for tailored and effective user interaction.

I am a member of Google Developer Groups and Google Student Developer Groups and actively participate in collaboration, learning, and contribute to open-source and campus projects.
